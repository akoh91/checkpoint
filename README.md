# CSE 6730 Project Checkpoint

This is the project checkpoint for Chris Dunlap, Allen Koh,
and Matt May.

You'll find our paper as `checkpoint.pdf`. Our Python code can
be found in the `code` subdirectory. Please refer to the README
in that directory as well for instructions on how to run our
code.

If you're anxious just to see something working, here's a video
of our running simulation on YouTube:
