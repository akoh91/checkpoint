# CSE 6730 Project Checkpoint

This is the project checkpoint for Chris Dunlap, Allen Koh,
and Matt May.

You'll find our paper as `checkpoint.pdf`. Our Python code can
be found in the `code` subdirectory. Please refer to the README
in that directory as well for instructions on how to run our
code.

If you would like to see a video of our working simulation, 
[here's a video of it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPjEm9cD4XU&feature=youtu.be).
